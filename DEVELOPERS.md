Git clone this repository, and `cd` into directory for remaining commands
```
git clone https://github.com/dominikbell/gpt2.git && cd gpt-2
```

Then, follow installation instructions. Instructions for a installation using Docker may be found on the [official repository's developers page](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md).

## Native Installation

All steps can optionally be done in a virtual environment using tools such as `venv`, `virtualenv`, or `conda`.

Install tensorflow 1.12 (with GPU support, if you have a GPU and want everything to run faster)
```
pip3 install tensorflow==1.12.0
```
or
```
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.12.0
```

Install other python packages:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the model data
```
python3 download_model.py 124M
python3 download_model.py 355M
python3 download_model.py 774M
python3 download_model.py 1558M
```

Some of the examples below may include Unicode text characters. Set the environment variable:
```
export PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8

to override the standard stream settings in UTF-8 mode.

## Unconditional sample generation

To generate unconditional samples from the small model:
```
python3 src/generate_unconditional_samples.py | tee /tmp/samples
```
There are various flags for controlling the samples:
```
python3 src/generate_unconditional_samples.py --top_k 40 --temperature 0.7 | tee /tmp/samples
```

To check flag descriptions, use:
```
python3 src/generate_unconditional_samples.py -- --help
```

## Conditional sample generation

To give the model custom prompts, you can use:
```
python3 src/interactive_conditional_samples.py --top_k 40
```

To check flag descriptions, use:
```
python3 src/interactive_conditional_samples.py -- --help
```
